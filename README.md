Error: Error locating chart

  on main.tf line 22, in resource "helm_release" "external-dns":
  22: resource "helm_release" "external-dns" {

```
```
```

### Important Factoids
<!--Are there anything atypical about your accounts that we should know? For example: Running in EC2 Classic? Custom version of OpenStack? Tight ACLs?-->
Terraform plan work like a charm with external-dns-chart-version <= 8.5.1 but failed with external-dns-chart-version >= 8.6.0.
I am able to install any version of this chart whith `helm install external-dns bitnami/external-dns --version x.y.z`
