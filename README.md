Error: Error locating chart

  on main.tf line 22, in resource "helm_release" "external-dns":
  22: resource "helm_release" "external-dns" {

Unable to locate chart external-dns: invalid_reference: invalid tag
```
```
```

### Other informations

Terraform plan work like a charm with external-dns-chart-version <= 8.5.1 but failed with external-dns-chart-version >= 8.6.0.

I am able to install any version of this chart whith `helm install external-dns bitnami/external-dns --version x.y.z`

I note a similar behavior with provider version: v2.17.0 except that the plan works but apply failed.
